After the first day of OOP, I was quite apprehensive about learning C++ and having to face the rest of the semester. However, after doing part two of the workshop, I felt reassured by how similar C and C++ languages can be. Although the concept of namespaces still confuses me (When and where should I implement my own namespaces, e.g. “sdds”?), I think after a few weeks, I will better understand. Afterall, when it comes to learning styles, I’m definitely a kinesthetic learner rather than auditory or visual.

Developing most of the functions was pretty easy. Function*strStr was the most difficult and took the longest time to complete. I spent about two hours trying to find/fix the bug that allowed the function to output the correct result, only if *str2 was actually in *str1. But, if *str2 were all the same letters (e.g. “bbb”) and *str1 contained just one of those letters, the function incorrectly returned the address instead of nullptr. At one point, I got so frustrated, I began writing the code through trial and error. To be honest, I’m still not sure how I came to the solution. However, later in the week, I plan to review this function again and understand where I went wrong.
