I love this week’s workshop. Apart from the very last function in part 2, it was very easy. Learning about overloaded operators made me realize how powerful C++ is. The only part that confused me is the allowed number of parameters. When I was coding, I got errors when I tried to include more than one parameter, but if the function was outside the class, it was allowed. I still don’t know why. The very last function was difficult for me; I kept getting ambiguity errors, and it took me a while to realize I needed to return the reference of val. These tricky problems can be really frustrating, but solving them is very satisfying. I hope to tackle more tricky problems like this after reading week. Hopefully, I will get better and faster.
