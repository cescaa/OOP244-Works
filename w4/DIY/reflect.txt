As a beginner in C++, I found learning about and using constructors easier than the topics covered in previous weeks. I found last week’s workshop very difficult; I was struggling to initialize my objects and ensure that they were in a “safe empty state,” but, I believe, because of constructors and the concept of “implicit invocation,” I did not face the same issues. I am very glad to add constructors to my toolbox of C++ knowledge: They conveniently initialize objects, which helps avoid undefined behavior and errors, and enforce “rules” during object creation, making setting up our code easier. Furthermore, because of the conventions of constructors (i.e. having the constructor definitions at the top of the file), they make reading, organizing and designing code easier too.
