Workshop 3 was a challenge, especially for Part 1. I foolishly thought it was going to be easy—so easy that I left only a few hours before it was due to submit to Matrix. But, I know now that was a huge mistake because my program could not deliver the expected output with the new data, and I was forced to submit Part 1 late. According to my output, my errors were “conditional jumps.” These errors occur when something in the program is trying to access variables that are not yet initialized. In other words, some part of my code failed to call setEmpty() on an Item object or Bill object or both. Honestly, I’m still not sure.


Due to my stressed out, panicked state over not handing the assignment in on time, I eventually gave up on logically thinking of a solution, and instead, tried to address the errors through basic trial and error; I experimented with different conditions in my loops; I attempted to call setEmpty() in places that were probably not necessary; Whatever I did, it worked. Before midterms, I’ll definitely go back and review my code to better understand the problem, and see where I went wrong/right.
